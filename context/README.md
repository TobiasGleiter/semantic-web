## 🚀 What is Syntax and Semantic? (Reference 1)

### How to differentiate Syntax and Semantic?

| Syntax                                    | Syntatic                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Hierachy of the data                      | Meaning                                        |
| Defines the allowed structure of the data | Define rules of syntatic correct sentences     |
| Describes what good data is               | Defines what can be estimated out of the rules |

Examples (Arithmetic):

```java
4+)=( //Syntatic wrong, -
```

```java
3+4=12 // Syntatic correct, semantic wrong
```

```java
3+4=7 // Syntatic correct, semantic correct
```
