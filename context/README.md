## üöÄ Syntax vs. Semantics: Understanding the Difference (Reference 1)

### Syntax

- Focuses on structure and form. It's like the grammar of a language, dictating how things are arranged.
- Example: `4+)=(` is syntactically wrong because it violates the rules of mathematical expression formation.

### Semantics:

- Focuses on meaning and interpretation. It's about what those structures actually convey.
- Example: While syntactically correct, `3+4=12` is semantically wrong because the actual sum is 7.

### Terms You Should Know:

- Semantic Technologies: Knowledge representation, systems, and expert systems.
- Semantic Web: Expanding the web with meaning beyond simple documents, using technologies like RDF(S) and OWL.
- Linked Data: Connecting data across different sources for wider knowledge access.

### Remember:

- Syntax is like the "how" while semantics is the "what".
- Both are crucial for understanding communication and processing information.

## ü§ò What is ontology in informatics? (Reference 1)

### Definition

Imagine a knoledge base as a treasure chest filled with information. **Ontology acts as the key**, unlocking its meaning and structure. It provides formal, explicit way to define concepts, relationships, and rules within that knowledge.

A definition by Tom Gruber 1993 and Willem Borst 1997 is: "An ontology is an formal and explicit representation of a shared conceptualisation."

### Example: Book Website with Ontology:

**Concepts:** Book, Author, Customer, Order.

**Relationships:** Written by (Book-Author), Purchased by (Book-Customer), Includes (Order-Book).

**Rules:** Book requires title & author, Customer needs name & address, Order contains in-stock books.

**Benefits:**

- Precise search (genre, author)
- Personalized recommendations
- Consistent data
- System integrations

### Rember

Ontology organizes info for smarter websites.

## ‚ùå Challenges in the Web of Text:

The "Web of Text" lacks structure and context, leading to several obstacles:

**1. Disambiguation:**

- **Search Queries:** "Bank" could refer to financial institutions or physical benches, confusing search engines.
- **Synonyms:** Searching for synonyms can miss relevant information without understanding their semantic connections.

**2. Information Representation:**

- **Unstructured formats:** Data within HTML documents lacks clear labeling, making it hard for machines to understand.
- **Missing context:** Phone numbers, addresses, or dates appear without explicit labels like "phone," "address," or "date," creating ambiguity.

**3. Information Extraction:**

- **Incomplete information:** Key facts might be missing or hidden within large text bodies, hindering comprehensive knowledge extraction.
- **Inconsistent formatting:** Variations in how information is presented (e.g., dates) make it challenging for machines to recognize and extract data consistently.

**4. Reasoning and Inference:**

- **Limited understanding:** Machines struggle to connect information across different sources and draw meaningful conclusions due to a lack of deeper understanding.
- **Unsolved ambiguity:** Uncertainties caused by multiple interpretations of text remain unresolved, limiting the accuracy of inferences.

### Rember

Addressing these challenges will require advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text understanding to unlock the full potential of the "Web of Text."
