## üöÄ Syntax vs. Semantics: Understanding the Difference (Reference 1)

### Syntax

- Focuses on structure and form. It's like the grammar of a language, dictating how things are arranged.
- Example: `4+)=(` is syntactically wrong because it violates the rules of mathematical expression formation.

### Semantics:

- Focuses on meaning and interpretation. It's about what those structures actually convey.
- Example: While syntactically correct, `3+4=12` is semantically wrong because the actual sum is 7.

### Terms You Should Know:

- Semantic Technologies: Knowledge representation, systems, and expert systems.
- Semantic Web: Expanding the web with meaning beyond simple documents, using technologies like RDF(S) and OWL.
- Linked Data: Connecting data across different sources for wider knowledge access.

### Remember:

- Syntax is like the "how" while semantics is the "what".
- Both are crucial for understanding communication and processing information.

## ü§ò What is ontology in informatics? (Reference 1)

### Definition

Imagine a knoledge base as a treasure chest filled with information. **Ontology acts as the key**, unlocking its meaning and structure. It provides formal, explicit way to define concepts, relationships, and rules within that knowledge.

A definition by Tom Gruber 1993 and Willem Borst 1997 is: "An ontology is an formal and explicit representation of a shared conceptualisation."

### Book Website with Ontology:

**Concepts:** Book, Author, Customer, Order.

**Relationships:** Written by (Book-Author), Purchased by (Book-Customer), Includes (Order-Book).

**Rules:** Book requires title & author, Customer needs name & address, Order contains in-stock books.

**Benefits:**

- Precise search (genre, author)
- Personalized recommendations
- Consistent data
- System integrations

### Rember

Ontology organizes info for smarter websites.
