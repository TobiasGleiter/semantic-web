## 🚀 What is Syntax and Semantic?

How to differentiate Syntax and Semantic:

Sytnax:

- Hierachy of the data
- Defines the allowed structure of the data
- Describes what good data is

Symantic:

- Meanting
- Define rules of syntatic correct sentences
- Defines what can be estimated out of the rules

Examples (Arithmetic):

```java
4+)=( //Syntatic wrong, -
```

```java
3+4=12 // Syntatic correct, semantic wrong
```

```java
3+4=7 // Syntatic correct, semantic correct
```
