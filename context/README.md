## 🚀 Syntax vs. Semantics: Understanding the Difference (Reference 1)

### Syntax

- Focuses on structure and form. It's like the grammar of a language, dictating how things are arranged.
- Example: `4+)=(` is syntactically wrong because it violates the rules of mathematical expression formation.

### Semantics:

- Focuses on meaning and interpretation. It's about what those structures actually convey.
- Example: While syntactically correct, `3+4=12` is semantically wrong because the actual sum is 7.

### Terms You Should Know:

- Semantic Technologies: Knowledge representation, systems, and expert systems.
- Semantic Web: Expanding the web with meaning beyond simple documents, using technologies like RDF(S) and OWL.
- Linked Data: Connecting data across different sources for wider knowledge access.

### Remember:

- Syntax is like the "how" while semantics is the "what".
- Both are crucial for understanding communication and processing information.
