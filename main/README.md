_Key words: Requirements_

## üéõÔ∏è What's Missing from the Web of Text?

The Web of Text lacks several key elements that hinder its full potential:

**Disambiguation of Homonyms:**

- Homonyms are words with the same spelling but different meanings (e.g., "bank" can refer to a financial institution or a riverbank).
- Without disambiguation, search engines and other applications can't understand the intended meaning, leading to inaccurate results.

**Meaning of Links:**

- Links are essential for navigation and information discovery on the web.
- However, the meaning of links (e.g., related content, source attribution, etc.) is often unclear.
- This limits the ability of machines to understand and utilize the information structure effectively.

**Relationships Between Elements:**

- The relationships between different elements on a web page (e.g., photos, text, videos) are often implicit.
- This makes it difficult for machines to understand the context and meaning of the content.

**What's Needed: Semantics**

To address these challenges, we need to incorporate semantics into the Web of Text. This involves:

- **Global Unique Identifiers for Entities:** Assigning unique identifiers to entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) allows for unambiguous identification and reference.
- **Methods to Express Relationships Between Entities:** A standardized, machine-readable format for expressing relationships between entities would enable better understanding and reasoning.
- **Fixed and Globally Unique Vocabulary:** A common vocabulary for representing concepts and relationships would ensure interoperability and improve machine comprehension.

### Benefits of Semantics

- Improved search and information retrieval
- Enhanced knowledge discovery and analysis
- More effective machine learning and artificial intelligence applications
- A more structured and interconnected web of information

### Rember

Incorporating semantics into the Web of Text will unlock its full potential, making it more accessible, understandable, and useful for both humans and machines.
